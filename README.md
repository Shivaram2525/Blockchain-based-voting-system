# Blockchain-Based Voting System

## 📌 Project Overview
The Blockchain-Based Voting System is a decentralized web application designed to conduct secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant electronic elections. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, the system ensures vote integrity, voter authentication, and immutable result storage without relying on a centralized authority.

This project is developed as an academic mini-project to demonstrate the practical application of blockchain technology in e-governance systems, particularly electronic voting.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To eliminate vote tampering and manipulation
- To ensure transparency and verifiability of election results
- To provide a secure and decentralized voting mechanism
- To demonstrate the use of smart contracts in real-world applications
- To reduce dependency on centralized election systems

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The system follows a decentralized architecture consisting of:
- Frontend user interface for voters and administrators
- Ethereum blockchain for secure vote storage
- Smart contracts for election logic and validation
- MetaMask wallet for user authentication and transaction signing

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Ethereum Blockchain**
- **Solidity** – Smart contract development
- **React.js** – Frontend development
- **Web3.js** – Blockchain interaction
- **MetaMask** – Wallet and user authentication
- **Node.js** – Development environment
